# Changelog

## 0.8.0 — 2026-04-10

### Features

- **Ctrl+Alt+Arrow clause navigation** — Navigate between logical clauses (field:value, groups, NOT expressions) with Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right. Selects each clause as the cursor moves. Enable via `features.clauseNavigation`. Groups with multiple clauses support enter/exit traversal; NOT and field groups support enter-only.
- **Error type categories on `ValidationError`** — Each validation error now includes a `type` field: `SYNTAX_ERROR`, `UNKNOWN_FIELD`, `INVALID_VALUE`, `AMBIGUOUS_PRECEDENCE`, or `CUSTOM`. Exported as `ValidationErrorType`.
- **`value`, `selectionStart`, `selectionEnd` on `DropdownOpenContext`** — The `dropdown.open` callback now receives the current input value and text selection range, enabling richer programmatic dropdown control.
- **Triggering event in `onSearch`** — `onSearch` callback now receives an optional third argument: the `KeyboardEvent` (Enter) or `MouseEvent` (button click) that triggered the search.
- **Date picker: year-level navigation (`«`/`»`)** — Jump by year in days view, decade in months view, or century in years view.
- **Date picker: adjacent month days** — Calendar grid shows previous/next month days in gray to fill the grid. Clicking them selects the date without navigating to that month.
- **Date picker: single-date presets** — Date presets now support `type?: 'single' | 'range'` to control which picker mode they appear in. Untyped presets appear in both.
- **Dismiss dropdown on editor scroll** — Scrolling the editor (wheel, scrollbar drag, touch swipe) closes the dropdown.

### Bug Fixes

- **Parser syntax errors missing `type` field** — Errors from the parser (unclosed parens, unexpected tokens) were reported without the `type` field. All parser errors now include `type: 'SYNTAX_ERROR'`.
- **Placeholder text bleeding outside narrow input** — Long placeholder text now clips with ellipsis instead of overflowing the input bounds.
- **Date picker nav button spacing** — `«`/`‹` and `›`/`»` buttons are now grouped with consistent spacing regardless of the center label width. Buttons also have a hover background.
- **Empty date preset trailing space** — Date presets with empty value (e.g. "Clear") no longer inject a trailing space.
- **`formatQuery` whitespace-only trim** — `formatQuery` now returns empty string for whitespace-only input instead of preserving it.

### Demo

- Added date presets (Today, Yesterday, Last 7/30/90 days, This year, Clear)
- Enabled Alt+Shift+F format query shortcut
- Added clause navigation toggle
- Exposed `inputApiRef` on `window.elasticInput` for console inspection

## 0.7.0 — 2026-04-09

### Breaking Changes

- **`formatQuery` preserves source operator form by default** — `&&`, `||`, `-`, and other operator variants are no longer normalized to `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`. The output matches what the user wrote. To force a specific style, use the new `andOperator`, `orOperator`, and `notOperator` options (e.g. `{ andOperator: 'AND', orOperator: 'OR', notOperator: 'NOT' }` restores the old behavior).

### Features

- **`features.formatQuery` accepts `FormatQueryOptions`** — Pass an options object instead of `true` to customize Alt+Shift+F formatting (e.g. `features: { formatQuery: { andOperator: '&&' } }`).
- **`andOperator` / `orOperator` / `notOperator` in `FormatQueryOptions`** — Force all boolean operators to a specific output form. When unset, the original source form is preserved. Prefix-style operators (`-`, `!`) attach directly; keyword-style operators (`NOT`, `AND`) get a space separator.
- **`sourceOperator` on AST nodes** — `BooleanExprNode` and `NotNode` now include a `sourceOperator` field capturing the original token text (`'&&'`, `'AND'`, `'||'`, `'OR'`, `'NOT'`, `'-'`, etc.).

### Bug Fixes

- **Alt+Shift keyboard shortcuts on macOS** — Alt+Shift+F (format query) and Alt+Shift+Arrow (expand selection) now use `e.code` (physical key) instead of `e.key`, fixing macOS where Alt (Option) produces special characters.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes

- **Backspace no longer clears entire input when content is only newlines** — Pressing Backspace after inserting multiple newlines via Shift+Enter cleared the entire input instead of removing one newline. `getPlainText` returned `''` for `<br>`-only DOM because `textContent` is empty (browsers leave an artifact `<br>` in empty contentEditable divs, and real newline `<br>` elements are indistinguishable). Backspace/Delete in newline-only content is now intercepted in the keydown handler and computed directly, matching the Shift+Enter pattern.
- **Dropdown description no longer truncated when `alignToInput=true`** — The description element in dropdown items had a hardcoded `maxWidth: 200px` that prevented it from using available space when the dropdown was wider (e.g. aligned to a wide input container). Replaced with `flexShrink`/`minWidth` so the flex layout determines the constraint naturally.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes

- **Wildcard values no longer eat the colon on suggestion accept** — Typing `code:?N` and accepting a suggestion produced `code"?N"` instead of `code:"?N"`. The cursor context now correctly recognizes WILDCARD tokens as field values after a colon.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes

- **Dropdown follows caret on Shift+Enter** — The dropdown now repositions to the new line after pressing Shift+Enter, including when the input was previously empty. Fixed three underlying issues: `getPlainText` treating `<br>`-only DOM as empty, `getCaretRect` reporting the wrong line after `<br>`, and trailing `<br>` not creating a visible empty line in contentEditable (fixed via sentinel `<br>`).

## 0.6.1 — 2026-04-08

### Enhancements

- **`renderFieldHint` works for any field** — Previously only customized hint suggestions that already existed (number/ip defaults or custom placeholder). Now fires for any field in value position — if no hint exists, one is injected at the top of the suggestion list.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-04-08

### Features

- **`collapseOnBlur` prop** — When `true`, the input collapses to a single line when unfocused and expands on focus. Useful for compact layouts where the full query is only needed during editing. Multiline `<br>` elements are replaced with spaces on blur and restored on focus.
- **Flex-friendly layout** — The container now uses `display: flex; flex-direction: column` instead of `inline-block`, and the editor has `flex: 1`. This lets the input work as a flex child where the parent determines height (editor scrolls when content overflows). Unconstrained layouts (default search bar, spreadsheet cells) are unaffected.
- **Caret scroll tracking** — The editor auto-scrolls to keep the caret visible after every input event (typing, Shift+Enter newlines). Prevents the caret from moving below the visible area in height-constrained scrollable inputs.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-04-08

### Breaking Changes

- **`SavedSearch` simplified** — Removed `id` and `name` fields. The `query` field now includes the `#` prefix (e.g. `#vip-active`) and is inserted as-is on acceptance. Added optional `label` (falls back to `query`) and changed `description` to `React.ReactNode`. The shape now matches `HistoryEntry`: `{ query, label?, description? }`.

### Improvements

- **Unified dropdown layout for history and saved searches** — Both types now use the same two-row layout when `description` is present (label on row 1, description + type badge on row 2) and collapse to a single-row layout when no description is provided. Line-clamp, word-break, and title tooltip behavior is shared.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-04-08

### Features

- **`styles.dropdownItemContentGap`** — Configurable gap between content elements inside dropdown items (label, type badge, description). Defaults to `'8px'`.
- **`SavedSearch.date`** — Optional date string on saved searches. When present, the item renders in a two-row layout (like history) with the date displayed alongside the description.

### Internal

- **Refactor dropdown item rendering** — Extracted shared `itemProps()`, `typeBadge()`, and merged history/saved-search two-row layout into a single code path. Net -58 lines.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes

- **`renderType` not applying to history suggestions** — History items had their own early-return render path that hardcoded the type badge as `"history"`, bypassing the `renderType` prop. Now respects `renderType`: `false` hides it, a function receives `'history'`, default shows `"history"`.

### CI

- **Cache Playwright browsers** — Playwright browser binaries are now cached between CI runs, reducing install time from ~13 minutes to seconds on cache hit.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes

- **Value suggestions not shown after field acceptance in `open="input"` mode** — Accepting a field name (e.g. `status:`) with Enter or Tab set the dropdown trigger to `'navigation'`, which caused the `open="input"` gate to block value suggestions from appearing. The trigger is now only set to `'navigation'` for complete terms (values, saved searches, history), not field names.

- **State update on unmounted component** — Pending `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks (dropdown positioning, post-accept suggestion updates, focus handler) were not cancelled on unmount, causing React warnings. All rAF IDs are now tracked and cancelled in the cleanup effect.

### Build

- **Browser tests in prepack** — `npm run test:browser` (Playwright) now runs as part of `prepack`, ensuring browser integration tests pass before publish.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-04-08

### Features

- **`defaultField` prop** — Sets an implicit field for bare (unfielded) terms, mirroring Elasticsearch's `default_field` parameter. When set, bare terms autocomplete as values of that field (showing date picker, boolean list, or value suggestions as appropriate) instead of field-name suggestions. Explicit `field:value` syntax still overrides. Pass a string for the common case, or `{ name, showFieldSuggestions }` to also show field names below value suggestions for discovery. Includes type-specific validation for bare terms (date format, number, boolean, IP) and passes field context to `validateValue`.
- **`trailingSpaceOnAccept` prop** — Controls whether accepting a suggestion or date inserts a trailing space after the value. Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` for spreadsheet/cell-style inputs where compact values are preferred.
- **No default placeholder** — The component no longer renders a default "Search..." placeholder. A placeholder only appears when the `placeholder` prop is explicitly provided.

### Demo

- Added **Spreadsheet** demo tab showing `defaultField` in a 3×3 table grid where each column targets a different field (Status, Deal Value, Created).

## 0.3.13 — 2026-04-07

### Bug Fixes

- **Controlled value prop not clearing editor DOM** — When a parent component cleared the `value` prop (e.g. `setValue('')`), the placeholder appeared but the old text remained in the editor. The paren-match effect was reading stale tokens from `stateRef` after `processInput` had already cleared the editor, then rebuilding the old highlighted HTML. `processInput` now syncs `stateRef.current.tokens` synchronously so effects in the same flush see the correct value.

### Demo

- Added **props.value** control to the demo sidebar — a text input and Clear button for testing controlled value reactivity.

## 0.3.12 — 2026-04-07

### Bug Fixes

- **Parentheses in input prevent blur** — Typing text with parentheses (e.g. `(a)`) and then clicking outside the input would trap focus. The paren-matching highlight effect and `applyHighlight` were restoring the caret position via `Selection.addRange()` after the editor was blurred, which re-focused the contentEditable. Caret restoration is now skipped when the editor is not focused.

## 0.3.11 — 2026-04-06

### Features

- **Double-click selects word without trailing whitespace** — Double-clicking a word in the editor now selects only the word, not the word plus trailing space (browser default). This makes double-click + Delete/Backspace preserve adjacent spacing. Triple-click (select all) is unaffected.

## 0.3.10 — 2026-04-06

### Bug Fixes

- **Blur cancels in-flight async suggestions** — Blurring the input now aborts pending async fetches (field values, saved searches, history) and clears debounce/loading timers. Previously, async results arriving after blur would re-open the dropdown with incorrect positioning.

### Testing

- **Vitest Browser Mode** — Added real-browser integration tests using Playwright. Covers field acceptance (Tab/Enter), async suggestion chaining, transient blur scenarios, and the blur-cancels-async fix. Run with `npm run test:browser` (headless) or `--browser.headless=false` for headed mode.

## 0.3.9 — 2026-04-02

### Build

- **Upgrade Vite to v8** — Aligns vite and vitest on a single `vite@8.0.3`, replacing the dual vite@5/vite@8 resolution that caused cross-platform lock file issues. Also upgrades `vite-plugin-dts` to v4.
- **Switch demo deployment to GitHub Actions** — Replaces `gh-pages` branch deployment with an `actions/deploy-pages` workflow.
- **Remove `@changesets/cli`** — Unused dependency and `.changeset/` directory removed.
- **Include README.md in npm package** — The `files` array was missing README.md, so it was excluded from the published tarball.

## 0.3.8 — 2026-04-02

### Bug Fixes

- **Validation tooltip clipped by overflow containers** — The error/warning tooltip now renders via a portal to `document.body` with `position: fixed`, preventing clipping by ancestor elements with `overflow: scroll/hidden/auto`.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-04-02

### Features

- **`dropdown.renderType` option** — Controls the type badge in dropdown items. `false` hides it entirely, `true` (default) shows the raw type string, or pass a `(type, suggestion) => ReactNode` callback for per-item customization.
- **`styles.lineHeight` option** — Configurable line height for the editor text and placeholder. Defaults to `'1.5'`.

## 0.3.6 — 2026-03-26

### Features

- **`dropdown.renderNoResults` callback** — Called when the autocomplete engine returns zero suggestions for a non-empty partial. Return a `ReactNode` to display a custom empty-state message in the dropdown, or `null` to fall back to the default hint. Receives `{ cursorContext, partial }`.
- **Alt+Shift+F format query (`features.formatQuery`)** — Opt-in keyboard shortcut that pretty-prints the current query in-place using `formatQuery`. Gated behind `features.formatQuery: true`.
- **`whitespaceOperator` option for `formatQuery`** — Controls how implicit AND (bare whitespace between terms) is rendered. By default implicit AND is preserved as whitespace; set `whitespaceOperator: 'AND'` or `'&&'` to make it explicit.
- **Implicit AND preservation in `formatQuery`** — `formatQuery` now distinguishes implicit AND (term juxtaposition) from explicit `AND` keywords and preserves whitespace by default, preventing unwanted operator injection.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-03-26

### Features

- **`dropdown.homeEndKeys` option** — Home/End navigate to the first/last dropdown item when enabled and an item is already selected. Keys pass through for normal cursor movement when no item is selected.
- **Dynamic PageUp/PageDown page size** — Page size is now calculated from the dropdown's visible height and item height instead of a fixed jump of 10.
- **`FormatQueryOptions`** — `formatQuery` now accepts an optional second argument with `maxLineLength` (default 60) and `indent` (default 2 spaces) options.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-03-26

### Features

- **`interceptPaste` prop** — Intercept paste events before text is inserted. The callback receives the plain-text clipboard content and can return a transformed string, `null` to cancel, or a Promise for async workflows (e.g. prompting the user). The component stays fully interactive while a promise is pending.
- **`dropdown.autoSelect` option** — When `true`, the first dropdown suggestion is pre-selected even with an empty partial (e.g. right after typing a colon). Off by default.
- **`formatQuery` utility** — Pretty-prints queries with line breaks at boolean operators, indented nested groups, and inline short expressions. Exported from the package.
- **`valueTypes` color config** — Per-field-type value colors (`string`, `number`, `date`, `boolean`, `ip`) on `ColorConfig`. Overrides the default `fieldValue` color based on the field's declared type.
- **`plainModeLength` prop** — Character count threshold that degrades the input to plain text mode (no highlighting, autocomplete, or validation). Set to `0` for always-plain.
- **PageUp/PageDown dropdown navigation** — Jumps by one visible page; PageDown clamps to last, PageUp clamps to first.
- **Arrow key wrap-around** — ArrowDown on the last dropdown item wraps to the first; ArrowUp on the first wraps to the last.

### Bug Fixes

- **Focus/blur cursor context** — Alt-tabbing away and back, then pressing Ctrl+Space, now correctly restores the cursor context instead of showing field-name suggestions.
- **JSDoc placement** — Moved the `ElasticInputProps` JSDoc comment to sit directly above the interface declaration.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-03-25

### Bug Fixes

- **Enter key blocked during async loading** — Pressing Enter while the "Searching..." spinner or an error item was displayed did nothing. Enter now closes the dropdown and submits the search, same as when no item is selected.
- **History description color on selection** — History item descriptions stayed gray when the row was highlighted. They now inherit the parent color and use standard 0.7 opacity, matching all other dropdown descriptions.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-03-25

### Features

- **`dropdown.loadingDelay`** — Configurable delay (ms) before showing the "Searching..." spinner on async fetches. Fast-responding endpoints skip the loading indicator entirely. Default `0` (immediate, preserving existing behavior).
- **`HistoryEntry.description`** — Replaced `HistoryEntry.timestamp` (number) with `description` (ReactNode). The consumer now controls what appears in the history item's secondary text. Styled consistently with other dropdown descriptions (inherited color, 0.7 opacity).
- **Auto-enable `savedSearches` / `historySearch`** — When `savedSearches` or `searchHistory` callback props are provided, their respective feature flags now default to `true` (no need to set `features.savedSearches` / `features.historySearch` explicitly).

### Breaking Changes

- `HistoryEntry.timestamp` removed — use `HistoryEntry.description` instead (accepts `ReactNode`).

## 0.3.1 — 2026-03-25

### Features

- **`suggestions` field config option** — Set `suggestions: false` on a `FieldConfig` to skip the `fetchSuggestions` async cycle entirely for that field. No "Searching..." spinner, no debounce timer, no dropdown. Defaults to `true`.

### Bug Fixes

- **Dropdown vanishing when dragging scrollbar** — The scroll/resize reposition handler used uncapped content height for the flip logic (same class of bug as the 0.3.0 fetchSuggestions fix, but in a different code path). With many suggestions the dropdown was repositioned off-screen during scrollbar drag.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-25

### Features

- **`dropdown.open` callback** — Rename `dropdown.mode` to `dropdown.open` (string values still work; `mode` accepted as deprecated fallback). `dropdown.open` also accepts a callback `(ctx: DropdownOpenContext) => boolean | null` for programmatic control: `true` forces open, `false` forces closed, `null` defers to the engine.
- **CSS classes (`classNames` prop)** — All key DOM elements now have static `ei-*` class names (e.g. `ei-container`, `ei-editor`, `ei-token`, `ei-dropdown`). A new `classNames` prop (`ClassNamesConfig`) lets consumers inject custom classes for Tailwind or external CSS styling.
- **Custom date parser (`parseDate` prop)** — `parseDate?: (value: string) => Date | null` lets consumers provide a custom date parser that supplements the built-in parser. Used in both validation (accepted before built-in checks) and date picker initialization.

### Bug Fixes

- **Dropdown invisible with large async result sets** — When `fetchSuggestions` returned many results (e.g. 500), the dropdown was positioned off-screen because the flip logic used the raw content height (16000px) instead of the CSS-capped rendered height (300px). Async results are now also truncated to `maxSuggestions`.

### Build

- Library dist is now shipped as unminified ESM — consumer bundlers handle minification.

### Deprecations

- `dropdown.mode` → use `dropdown.open` instead (string values are identical; `mode` still works).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-03-25

### Minor Changes

- Move field value, saved search, and history filtering to callbacks

  **Breaking changes:**

  - Removed `FieldConfig.suggestions`, `FieldConfig.asyncSearch`, and `FieldConfig.asyncSearchLabel` — all field value suggestions now come exclusively through the `fetchSuggestions` callback
  - `savedSearches` callback signature changed from `() => Promise<SavedSearch[]>` to `(partial: string) => Promise<SavedSearch[]>` — called per-keystroke (debounced) instead of once on mount
  - `searchHistory` callback signature changed from `() => Promise<HistoryEntry[]>` to `(partial: string) => Promise<HistoryEntry[]>` — called per-keystroke (debounced) instead of once on mount
  - `AutocompleteEngine` no longer filters saved search or history results (passes through as-is); filtering is the caller's responsibility

  **Migration:**

  - Move static `suggestions` arrays into your `fetchSuggestions` callback
  - Remove `asyncSearch` and `asyncSearchLabel` from field configs — `fetchSuggestions` is now called for all non-boolean field value contexts
  - Update `savedSearches`/`searchHistory` callbacks to accept a `partial` parameter and filter server-side

  Boolean `true`/`false` suggestions and freeform placeholder hints are still generated by the engine.
